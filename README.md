# Portfolio Site - Mario Ferrera
This project involves the process of building a protfolio site from sratch using HTML, SASS, and a little JavaScript. Along with previous workflows I've established, I also created a new Web Development Process Document to give me a better roadmap for the completion of key milestones. That document can be found in the doc folder.
